  Day1:
  - I see you have met my little sister, has she annoyed you enough yet?
  - "But she\u2019s a good kid, a bit too high energy for me at times though. She
    takes a lot of her personality from our uncle."
  - "I don\u2019t think she told you where we\u2019re from, we\u2019re from two different
    places. Tomato is from Spain and I am from Ireland."
  - "Ha you\u2019ve made it to the last riddle."
  - I am hidden at the end of area where light barely reaches.
  Day2:
  - "I see you have met our uncle, he\u2019s a bit fiery, but he\u2019s always been
    there for us."
  - He gets his Chilean descent from his mother. Chilli is great, but between us,
    Europe is a much nicer place.
  - "That\u2019s where we\u2019re from, that might be why anyway."
  Day3:
  - "Tomato and I\u2019s da died when we were young, although she thinks he died
    in a kitchen accident, he was actually a drunk who fell down a well."
  - "Please\u2026 don\u2019t tell her."
