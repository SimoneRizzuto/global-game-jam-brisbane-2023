  Day1:
  - Need water!!!
  - Leif pours water onto chilli*
  - "Thanks for the water but now I\u2019m steaming that you put me next to corn
    though, he can get a lil preachy."
  - "If you haven\u2019t noticed from my accent I\u2019m from Chile. I like to think
    my body resembles the shape of the country. Do you see it, amiga?."
  - "You think Corn\u2019s riddle was good. Take a shot at mine."
  - Find the area where plants existed before me.
  Day2:
  - "In my homeland my Papi is legendary for his spiciness. His nickname was \u2018Picante
    de Volcan\u2019. I will reach his legend someday."
  Day3:
  - "Wow! Jack O has such a estupido face. He thinks he\u2019s so cool having a single
    letter last name. It\u2019s like the opposite of Madonna"
  Day4:
  - You see steam coming off Chili*
  - Why did she leave without a goodbye!?
  - In my homeland, it is considered dishonourable to leave without saying goodbye!
  Day5:
  - "Ah you\u2019ve met my amazing niece and nephew, they\u2019re a bit polar opposites
    but they care for each other in their own sibling way."
  Day6:
  - "He told you his name, didn\u2019t he? The absolute \u2018cono\u2019, he was
    never this way with grandma, she always made him talk."
  Day7: []
