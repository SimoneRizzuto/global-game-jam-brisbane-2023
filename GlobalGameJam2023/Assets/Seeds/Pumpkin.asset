  Day3:
  - Hey there, thanks for the water Leif O, your Nonna told me all about you, but
    anyway you can call me O. Jack O.
  - "This is an interesting new crew you have me with here, like the man who laughs
    at all his own jokes and the man that\u2019ll burn you to a crisp if you even
    just sneeze on him."
  - "But I\u2019m a people person. I\u2019ve dealt with people my whole life and
    if you can get em to talk, you understand the world."
  - "I\u2019m gonna cut to the chase young Leif O, that next seed that you\u2019re
    lookin for I saw it sitting on a lantern somewhere."
  Day4:
  - "You know a melon is dumb when you split their head open and they\u2019re seedless.
    Right?"
  Day5:
  - "I heard Chilli complaining about me yesterday, but just between you and me,
    my last name is\u2026 O\u2019Lantern. Just don\u2019t tell anyone, capish?"
  Day6:
  - "You know kid you\u2019re smart, you can get away with anything."
  - Cause a fish with its mouth closed never gets caught.
  Day7:
  - Ya nonna was a wonderful lady, I hope you respect her as much as I do.
  - "With her and Corn\u2019s help, they saved me from a pretty sticky situation."
  - "But she was family to me, which makes you family, and I\u2019ll always take
    care of you."
  - "I\u2019m gonna cut to the chase young Leif O, that next seed that you\u2019re
    lookin for I saw it sitting on a lantern somewhere."
